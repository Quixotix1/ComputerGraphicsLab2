Creating these two shaders was an interesting challenge. I have formerly used Blender shaders, so I had a background with simple graph techniques, but this still pushed me a bit to come up with a correct solution. In the end, I realized that I could create a subtract block and remove a color from the original texture to create the final shader for the first example (challenge 2). The second was a bit easier: I created a Lerp block between two textures and added a float variable that determines the exact amount to interpolate between the two so that it's easily configurable.
